### Abstract

> *We address the task of generating query suggestions for task-based search. The current state of the art relies heavily on suggestions provided by a major search engine. In this paper, we solve the task without reliance on search engines. Specifically, we focus on the first step of a two-stage pipeline approach, which is dedicated to the generation of query suggestion candidates. We present three methods for generating candidate suggestions and apply them on multiple information sources. Using a purpose-built test collection, we find that these methods are able to generate high-quality suggestion candidates.* 


### Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

 - `data/`: TSV file used for evaluating the query suggestions. It was obtained by post-processing the test collection (details in the paper).

 - `output/`: all the final TSV run files, containing query suggestions generated by different methods and sources used in the paper.


## Results

Results presented in the paper can be obtained by running the evaluation script, indicating the metrics of interest.

```
$ python eval.py 10  # P@10
$ python eval.py 20  # P@20
```

## Crowdsourcing experiments

We seek to measure the quality of question suggestions for task-based search. Please see details below.
